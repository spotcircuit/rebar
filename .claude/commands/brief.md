description: Generate a standup/handoff summary from a client's expertise.yaml
argument-hint: <client-name>
---

# SE: Brief

Generates a one-page summary of a client engagement — suitable for standup, handoff,
or onboarding a new SE. Reads entirely from expertise.yaml (no live queries).

## Variables

CLIENT: $ARGUMENTS

## Resolution

Resolve CLIENT to a base directory. Check `clients/CLIENT`, then `apps/CLIENT`, then `tools/CLIENT`:
- If `clients/CLIENT/expertise.yaml` exists → BASE_DIR = `clients/CLIENT`
- Else if `apps/CLIENT/expertise.yaml` exists → BASE_DIR = `apps/CLIENT`
- Else if `tools/CLIENT/expertise.yaml` exists → BASE_DIR = `tools/CLIENT`
- Else if CLIENT is empty: scan `clients/*/expertise.yaml`, `apps/*/expertise.yaml`, and `tools/*/expertise.yaml` (excluding `_templates`). If exactly one match, use it. Otherwise list all and ask.

EXPERTISE: BASE_DIR/expertise.yaml

## Instructions

- Read `BASE_DIR/expertise.yaml` — stop if it doesn't exist
- This is READ ONLY — no files are modified
- Keep output concise and human-readable — this is for people, not agents
- If a section is empty or ~, say "not yet documented" rather than showing the raw YAML

## Step 1: Read expertise.yaml

Read `BASE_DIR/expertise.yaml` in full.

## Step 2: Generate Brief

Output the following summary to the terminal:

```
